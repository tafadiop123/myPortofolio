  My role is to improve the speed and accuracy of brain tumor detection and localization based on MRI images. 
  This could drastically reduce the cost of cancer diagnosis and could help diagnose tumors earlier which would be a life saver. 
  MRI images of brains were collected and they approached me about developing a model that could detect and localize tumors.

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  The goal of the project is to classify the emotions of people based on their images. 
  We have collected more than 20 thousand images of human faces, 
  with their facial expressions labeled and about 2000 images with their facial key point annotations.

  title="Two Handwritten Signatures Comparison"

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  The purpose of this project was to perform the comparison between 2 signatures for the verification of a signature in a banking document entirely done by AI. 
  In this approach, we will use Siamese networks to learn the similarity function. 
  Siamese means 'twins' and the biggest difference between normal nn's is that these networks try to learn the approximate the similarity function 
  instead of trying to classify.

  title="segmentation et Clustering de Clients"

>
  This report is about the clustering of Mr. Sylla's customers. 
  First of all, there are different types of segmentation: geographic, demographic, psychological, behavioral, etc. 
  In our case, we will use customer purchase information for a period of one and a half years (2020 to 2021) in order to understand customer behavior. 
  Therefore, we will try to define customer typologies according to their behavior.

>
  "CREATIVE AI" is a new branch of artificial intelligence in which AI can perform artistic painting, 
  can design exciting stories and can compose music. 
  Therefore, in this project, an algorithm was developed that creates artistic works from photos.

  title="Predictive Scoring of Prospects by Machine Learning"

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  This project consisted of predicting the transformation score of a prospect
  into a new customer. Using the Python language, I developed a predictive
  scoring algorithm in machine learning with the help of the XG Boost algorithm
  and a data science method called K-Fold Stratified.

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  In this project I developed a deep learning algorithm for face mask port
  recognition against Covid-19.

  title="ID Verification"

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  This deep learning project developed with Python allows identity verification.
  The algorithm developed here takes a picture of an ID card and compares it to
  selfies taken by the user in real-time and the AI will be able to determine if
  the user is indeed the one presenting the ID card.
