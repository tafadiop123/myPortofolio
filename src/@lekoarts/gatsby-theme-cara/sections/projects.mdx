  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  The code is based on the Python language and to achieve this I used the YoloV4
  algorithm that I trained the neural networks to detect any handwritten
  signature on a document in (.png) format.

>
  This project consisted of predicting the transformation score of a prospect
  into a new customer. Using the Python language, I developed a predictive
  scoring algorithm in machine learning with the help of the XG Boost algorithm
  and a data science method called K-Fold Stratified.

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  It's a deep learning project developed with Python where I used "Siamese
  Neural Networks" to compare if two handwritten signatures are similar.

>
  In this project I developed a deep learning algorithm for face mask port
  recognition against Covid-19.

  bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)"
>
  This deep learning project developed with Python allows identity verification.
  The algorithm developed here takes a picture of an ID card and compares it to
  selfies taken by the user in real-time and the AI will be able to determine if
  the user is indeed the one presenting the ID card.

  This project is a web application developed with Node JS and Javascript. It is
  an application for selling agricultural products online.
